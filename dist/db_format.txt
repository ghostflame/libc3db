Offset		Len		What
0			4		Magic number, 'CCCC'
4			2		Database version
6			2		Header size
8			4		Config checksum
12			2		Config block count
14			2		Empty
16			16		Config block { i64 count1, i64 interval1, u64 offset1 }
32			16		Config block { i64 count2, i64 interval2, u64 offset2 }
...

offset1		20		Bucket { i64 nsec timestamp, u32 count, flt sum, flt min, flt max }
...
offset2		20		Bucket { i64 nsec timestamp, u32 count, flt sum, flt min, flt max }

offset1 = after all the configs
offset2 = offset1 + ( sizeof( Bucket ) * count1 )
...


Open the DB and compare config checksums.  If they don't match, we cannot write.
Get offset1 and work out where each ts will go.  Read those buckets out.
Get offset2 and work out where each ts will go.  Read those buckets out.

Update the buckets with as many points as necessary.

Write those offsets back.  Close DB.
